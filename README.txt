# sxript

Sxript is an interpreted functional/procedural programming language designed for numerical evaluation and problem solving with high-order functions, variable storage, scoped subprograms, and arbitrary-precision numbers, along with file I/O, graphical output, and more. Sxript may be used as a stand-alone tool on most devices, or included as a component of any BASIC, JavaScript, or C++ application. All source code is written in a strict subset of the QB45 language, and is auto-translated by the BAS-TO-X utility into other languages.
